Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona GSE. My research interests are in macroeconomics, information frictions, and monetary policy.

I will be available for interviews at the SaE in Madrid, EEA in Naples, and ASSA meeting in Atlanta.

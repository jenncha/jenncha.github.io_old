*[Monetary Policy and Sentiment Driven Fluctuations (Job Market Paper)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lijn2c53uech9ig/ChanJ_JMP.pdf?dl=0)* <br>
[Abstract] I study optimal monetary policy in the presence of non-fundamental sources of fluc- tuations. Sentiments, or beliefs about aggregate demand, can be self-fulfilling in mod- els departing slightly from the assumption of complete information in the benchmark New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, the stance of monetary policy determines the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive, and consequently, the degree of coordination in firmsâ€™ production (pricing) decision. As a result, the distribution of non-fundamental shocks is no longer independent of policy, introducing a novel tradeoff between stabilizing output and inflation. Strong inflation targeting, the optimal policy response to fundamental shocks, increases the variance of non-fundamental fluctuations, which is shown to be suboptimal. The Taylor rule is no longer sufficient to rule out indeterminacy. Instead, a more lax response to infla- tion allows the policymaker to eliminate non-fundamental fluctuations and hence the output-inflation tradeoff.

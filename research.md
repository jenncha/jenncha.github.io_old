*[Monetary Policy and Sentiment Driven Fluctuations (Job Market Paper)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lijn2c53uech9ig/ChanJ_JMP.pdf?dl=0)* <br>
[Abstract] I study optimal monetary policy in the presence of non-fundamental sources of fluctuations. Sentiments, or beliefs about aggregate demand can be self-fulfilling in models departing slightly from the assumption of complete information in the benchmark New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, the stance of monetary policy determines the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive, and consequently, the degree of coordination in firmsâ€™ production (price setting). As a result, the distribution of shocks is no longer independent of policy, introducing a novel tradeoff between stabilizing output and inflation. Strong inflation targeting, the optimal policy response to fundamental shocks, increases the variance of non-fundamental fluctuations, which is shown to be suboptimal. Although a more lax response to inflation allows the policymaker to eliminate non-fundamental fluctuations and hence the output-inflation tradeoff, this equilibrium is not robust to the introduction of fundamental shocks. In the presence of technology shocks, this unique equilibrium exhibits fluctuations from both fundamental and non-fundamental sources, with the result that the policymaker can no longer eliminate the latter.

*[Monetary Policy and Sentiment Driven Fluctuations (Job Market Paper)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/narfws9d7g30hd0/ChanJ_JMP.pdf?dl=0)* <br>
[Abstract] This paper considers optimal monetary policy in the presence of non-fundamental sources of fluctuations. Such fluctuations arise in models departing slightly from the complete information assumption in the benchmark New Keynesian framework. In particular, if firms commit to production (price) based on imperfect information about demand, information frictions and nominal rigidities in wage (price) setting introduce a novel tradeoff between stabilizing output and inflation. The nominal interest rate serves a new function by modifying the use of information by firms. Strong inflation targeting, the optimal policy response to fundamental shocks, increases the variance of non-fundamental fluctuations, which are shown to be inefficient. Moreover, in the presence of technology shocks, the unique equilibrium exhibits fluctuations from both fundamental and non-fundamental sources. As stabilizing the economy in response to non-fundamental fluctuations is orthogonal to the optimal response to a technology shock, the policymaker faces a tradeoff in responding optimally to each.
